/**
 * \ingroup MicroServices
 *
 * The CppMicroServices Framework.
 *
 * <p>
 * A Framework is itself a bundle and is known as the "System Bundle".
 * The System Bundle differs from other bundles in the following ways:
 * - The system bundle is always assigned a bundle identifier of zero (0).
 * - The system bundle <code>GetLocation</code> method returns the string: "System Bundle".
 * - The system bundle's life cycle cannot be managed like normal bundles. Its life cycle methods
 *   must behave as follows:
 *   - Start - Does nothing because the system bundle is already started.
 *   - Stop - Stops all installed bundles.
 *   - Uninstall - The Framework must throw a std::runtime_error exception indicating that the
 *     system bundle cannot be uninstalled.
 *
 * Framework instances are created using a FrameworkFactory. The methods of this class can be
 * used to manage and control the created framework instance.
 *
 * @remarks This class is thread-safe.
 *
 * @see FrameworkFactory::NewFramework(std::map<std::string, us::Any> configuration)
